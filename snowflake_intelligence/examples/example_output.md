## SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Storm Melissa presents a significant threat to Jamaica on October 28, 2025 at 00Z UTC. The current forecast indicates substantial escalation risk, with a potential for severe humanitarian impacts, especially for vulnerable populations and social infrastructure.

At the 50kt wind threshold, the situation demands close monitoring and preparation, as more than 260,000 people—including over 71,000 children—are expected to face risk, with certain areas projected for rapid escalation.

## SECTION 2: EXPECTED IMPACT

**Expected Impacts (at the 50kt wind threshold)**

- **Forecast date:** October 28, 2025 00Z UTC
- **Expected population at risk:** 260,194
- **Expected children at risk:** 71,968 children (52,691 school-age children ages 5-15, 19,277 infants ages 0-4)
- **Expected schools at risk:** 31
- **Expected health centers at risk:** 30

The forecast suggests concentrated risk primarily in Saint James, Saint Elizabeth, and Hanover. Close attention should be paid to regions with escalated vulnerability. The relatively high absolute numbers require preemptive coordination for essential resources and protection.

**Worst-Case Scenario**

- **Ensemble Member #8** worst-case: 980,352 population at risk
- **Children at risk:** 266,620 (196,817 school-age children ages 5-15, 69,803 infants ages 0-4)
- **Schools at risk:** 113
- **Health centers at risk:** 84

Worst-case impacts are 3.8 times higher than expected at the 50kt wind threshold, signaling a credible escalation risk for the country if forecast conditions worsen. Planning should focus on expected scenarios, but buffers for severe contingencies are required.

Analyzing the distribution for the 50kt threshold, there are 42 ensemble members. Only 9.5% of members project impacts within 20% of the worst-case, with population impacts ranging from 1,631 to 980,352; the median is 224,394 and the mean is 315,950. Children impacts range from 434 to 266,620 (median 62,904); school impacts range from 0 to 113 (median 27); health centers from 0 to 96 (median 29).

**PLAUSIBLE but NOT MOST LIKELY**  
9.1% of ensemble members project impacts within 20% of worst-case, and worst-case is 3.1 times higher than median. While most scenarios cluster around moderate impacts, a meaningful minority (9.1%) project severe outcomes. This suggests worst-case represents a credible escalation risk that should be monitored, but primary planning should focus on expected scenarios with contingency buffers for escalation.

If conditions worsen, impacts could rise from expected (260,194) toward worst-case (980,352), highlighting escalation risk mainly for key parishes.

At higher thresholds (64kt/83kt), population impacts drop sharply—e.g., at 64kt only 64,944 people at risk (96.7% reduction from 34kt), indicating most impacts occur in less-exposed or more robust regions.

## SECTION 4: TREND ANALYSIS

In comparing the current forecast (October 28, 2025 00Z UTC) to the previous run (October 27, 2025 18Z UTC) at the 50kt wind threshold, most administrative areas show escalating risk. The most significant increases are focused in Saint James (+20,409), Clarendon (+10,755), and Saint Elizabeth (+10,207)—reflecting a steep rise compared to previous forecast data.

The upward trend in affected population across several parishes signals an intensifying situation that requires dynamic reassessment and heightened readiness at critical sites.

  
| Administrative Area | Current | Previous | Change |
|---------------------|---------|----------|--------|
| Saint James         | 81,686  | 61,277   | 20,409 |
| Clarendon           | 15,360  | 4,605    | 10,755 |
| Saint Elizabeth     | 31,253  | 21,046   | 10,207 |
| Saint Catherine     | 9,258   | 217      | 9,041  |
| Saint Ann           | 27,010  | 18,441   | 8,569  |
| Saint Mary          | 9,819   | 1,700    | 8,119  |
| Hanover             | 31,081  | 24,665   | 6,416  |
| Trelawny            | 19,328  | 13,833   | 5,495  |
| Westmoreland        | 28,276  | 24,078   | 4,198  |
| Manchester          | 6,248   | 3,880    | 2,368  |
| Saint Thomas        | 398     | 0        | 398    |
| Portland            | 273     | 68       | 205    |
| Saint Andrew        | 200     | 0        | 200    |
| Kingston            | 0       | 0        | 0      |


Largest increases are seen in Saint James, Clarendon, and Saint Elizabeth. No areas showed risk reduction; all either worsened or remained stable, underscoring country-wide escalation, with prioritization required in the fastest-escalating parishes.

## SECTION 5: KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Storm Melissa's current forecast poses a substantial threat, with escalation risk up to 3.8 times the expected impact for Jamaica at the 50kt threshold.
- The highest risks concentrate in Saint James, Saint Elizabeth, and Hanover, where population and children exposure are especially elevated.
- The overall situation is escalating, with no admin areas improving; readiness and response efforts should prioritize rapidly worsening regions and contingency for severe scenarios.
